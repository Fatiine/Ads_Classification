# Technical test

Our technical test contain two parts:
- Show your skills part
- Question answering part

## Show your skiils

You will find **train** and **test** set inside folder `dataset`, you will need to make a data analysis and build a sophisticated (on your point of view) classification model (ML or DL). The field that you will need to predict is `ad_customerSpecific_moderationDecision`, of course **test** set doesn't contain this field and you will need to provide us predictions for this dataset at the end.

You can use any fraemwork that you like, there's no restriction. At the end, we are expecting a data analysis (could be just a simple notebook), the code (notebook is also fine) and the predictions for the test set (index column with a column named prediction).

## Question answering

Here is a list of the quesitons, be free to answer to it in order that you prefer.

- How do you manage the training of a model?
- How would you split your dataset when you have a supervised learning problem?
- How would you evaluate a model (classification)?
